# MOCK-CENSUS-ANALYSIS-OF-UK-POPULATION

This project involves the analysis of a mock census dataset from an imaginary town. I am assuming the role of a local government team member responsible for making decisions on developing an unoccupied plot of land and determining investment priorities. This process involves cleaning and analyzing the provided mock census data.

# About the Mock Census
The provided mock census data has been generated using the Faker package in Python, designed to emulate the format of the 1881 UK census. The dataset includes the following fields:

Street Number: Set to “1” if it is a unique dwelling.
Street Name
First Name of Occupant
Surname of Occupant
Age of Occupant
Relationship to Head of Household: Any person over 18 who filled out the census details.
Marital Status: Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed, or “NA” for minors.
Gender: Male or Female (other responses were not implemented in 1881).
Occupation: Implemented in a modern style.
Infirmity: A limited set of infirmities following the style of 1881.
Religion: A set of real-world religions.
# Analysis
The dataset was initially cleaned to rectify any missing entries and inaccuracies. This refined dataset was then subsequently used for various analyses to inform my decisions.
# Tasks

## Development of Unoccupied Land
This will depend on the outcome of the analysis although the options are:
High-Density Housing: Ideal if the population is significantly expanding.
Low-Density Housing: Suitable for an affluent population with a demand for large family homes.
Train Station: To support a large number of commuters and reduce road congestion.
Religious Building: Assess the need for a new place of worship based on the religious demographics.
Emergency Medical Building: A minor injuries center if there are many injuries or anticipated future pregnancies.
Other Proposals: Justify any other suggestions based on data analysis.

## Investment Priorities
Determining which area should receive investment in terms of:

Employment and Training: Focus on retraining if unemployment rates are high.
Old Age Care: Allocate resources for end-of-life care if there is an increasing number of retirees.
School Funding: Increase funding if there is a growing population of school-aged children.
General Infrastructure: Invest in services such as waste collection and road maintenance if the town is expanding.

# To support my decisions, i conducted further analyses:

1. Creation of an age pyramid to understand population growth or decline and future demographic trends.
2. Analysis of which age groups are mostly affected by unemployment.
3. Identifying trends in religious growth or decline.
4. Examining how marriage and divorce rates impacts housing needs.
5. Assessing whether existing housing is under or over-utilized.
6. Determining the number of commuting students and other professionals.
7. Calculations of the birth and death rates to understand population dynamics.

8. These analyses helped to justify my recommendations for land development and investment priorities, balancing the diverse needs of the population through statistical evidence and hypothesis testing.

9. This project simulates real-world decision-making processes using artificial data.
